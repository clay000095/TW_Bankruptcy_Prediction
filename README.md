## TW_Bankruptcy_Prediction

This is a great approach to a project from Kaggle's competition database predicting corporate bankruptcy in Taiwan. The process involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing EDA and visualization, and finally fitting the data into different machine learning models. Using various machine learning models and selecting the best model to make predictions is a very wise approach.

Achieving a 99% F1-score is an excellent result, which indicates that the model can classify the data accurately. However, to avoid overfitting, it is essential to evaluate model performance on a validation set. Moreover, further model adjustments can be made to improve model performance and make it more suitable for the application.

Overall, this is a great example of how to approach a machine learning project, and the outcome shows that the process was executed effectively. The ability to clean data, explore it through EDA, and fit it into a suitable model is a crucial step in building an effective machine learning model.
